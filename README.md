Codealoy is an open-source interactive learning web platform that intend to make learning programming & web development easier in **Bangla** (Bengali Language).

## Tech Stack

We've used the [_"T3 Stack"_](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app) which focused on **simplicity**, **modularity**, and **full-stack typesafety**.

Here are the building blocks of Codealoy:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [Markdoc](https://markdoc.dev)
